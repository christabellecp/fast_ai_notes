    "### **KEY NOTES**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **OBJECTS**\n",
    "1. ImageDataBunch = contains 2 or 3 data sets (training, validation and testing)\n",
    "2. ConvLearner = creates convolutional neural net (**inputs:** databunch, model/architecture (resnet34 and resnet50, number of layers **optional:** input metrics which prints something out like error rate )\n",
    "3.  Resenet34 was already trained looking at one and half million pictures looking at a thousand of different things. We download those pre-trained weights so we don't start with nothing. Uses ImageNet. \n",
    "4. ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(convlearner) #see what comes out, interpretation of model\n",
    "5. Path object \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **FUNCTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. untar_data = download extract data from URL\n",
    "    input = URL\n",
    "    output=extracted data in a path\n",
    "2. help = shows how to use a function, gives type information\n",
    "3. get_image_files = grabs all image files in an array\n",
    "    input = image file\n",
    "    output = array of all image files\n",
    "4. transforms = makes something size 224 and center crops (crop and resize)\n",
    "5. normalize = makes all data about the same size (same mean and SD)\n",
    "13. docs(method class or function) = tells information \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DATABUNCH FUNCTIONS\n",
    "1. databunch.show_batch = shows some contents (images) in databunch\n",
    "    input: rows\n",
    "    output: contents of data bunch\n",
    "2. databunch.classes = shows all of the labels\n",
    "8. databunch.c = can think of as number of classes for classification problems not regression\n",
    "4. databunch.from_folder(path, ds_tfms=tfms, size=26) - creates a databunch if the labels of the data are the folder in which the files are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### CONVLEARNER FUNCTIONS\n",
    "1. ConvLearner.fit_one_cycle() = fits the data to classifier (input: how many cycles?, creates the weights)\n",
    "10. ConvLearner.save('name')  = saves the weights\n",
    "3. ConvLearner.unfreeze() = please train the whole model\n",
    "4. ConvLearner.load('name') = loads the previously saved model weights\n",
    "5. ConvLeaner.lr_find() = what is the fastest I can train the model at where it maintains accuracy\n",
    "6. ConvLearner.recorder.plot() = plots learning rate and loss\n",
    "7. ConvLearner.fit_one_cycle(2, max_lr = slice(1e-6, 1e-4) (passes a range of learning rates, train early layers at 1e-6 and later layers at 1e-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### CLASSIFICATIONINTERPRETATION FUNCTIONS\n",
    "1. ClassificationInterpretation.plot_top_losses(number) = shows the top errors, loss, label and prediction, one of the most useful things\n",
    "12. ClassificationInterpretation.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(12,12), dpi=60) = for every actual dog or cat, how many times was it predicted, hard to see if very accurate so instead use...\n",
    "13. ClassificationInterpretation.most_confused(min_val=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **KEY POINTS**\n",
    "1. **Transfer Learning:** Takes a model that already knows how to do one thing really well and tries to get it to do our thing really well. Can trained models 1/100 or less of the time usually needed with 1/100 or less data.\n",
    "2. **Overfitting:** Learning to recognize particular photos\n",
    "3. **Validation set:** set our model never got to see\n",
    "4. **Unfreezing**\n",
    "5. **Fine Tuning** Make model better by fine tuning. We took a premade model with a lot of layers, added a few layers at the end and trained those. When we went ahead and trained the entire model, the error rate increased. \n",
    "6. **Ways to label data**: From a folder with the label names (databunch.from_folder), from a csv file with a label column (.from_csv), in a file name or path (from_name_re, or from_name_func), an array of labels (pass it in the imagedatabunch)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q&A Notes**\n",
    "1. What if the labels are part of the path name? \n",
    "   Extract labels from names using regular expressions\n",
    "2. GPU has to provide the exact same instruction to everything at the same time and in order to do this quickly = make them all the same shape. Most use 224 x 224. This generally just works.\n",
    "3. Why use resnet?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ADVICE**\n",
    "1. Always take a look at your data and your labels\n",
    "2. Start with resnet34 since it trains faster and see if it's good enough\n",
    "3. Spend a lot of time looking at the fast.ai documentation\n",
    "4. Pick one project, do it really well\n",
    "5. We always need to know the inputs and outputs of our functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PROCESS**\n",
    "1. Import (from fastai.vision import *, from fastai.metrics import error_rate)\n",
    "2. Create a path & extract all data (untar_data()\n",
    "3. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **TO-DO**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **READING & EXPLORING**\n",
    "1. envision - ai\n",
    "2. papers with code\n",
    "3. fastai_docs #can download repos\n",
    "4. https://regexr.com/ # visualize regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **QUESTIONS**\n",
    "1. What are path objects?\n",
    "2. Why is normalization important?\n",
    "3. What is one cycle?\n"
